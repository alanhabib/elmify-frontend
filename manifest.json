      "bio": "Abdulrahman Hassan is uniquely positioned as an individual who combines the experience of traditional Islamic scholarship from the East, as well as the knowledge and understanding of the West. By the tender age of 10, Allah allowed him to memorise The Qur’an and Buloogh Al Maraam – a book that contains more than 1,300 hadith. He then went on to formally study Islam in Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Somalia, before returning to the UK as an Imaam and a da’ee. He has delivered hundreds of hours of Islamic content on YouTube and has fast become a popular name amongst the English-speaking Muslim audience.\n",
